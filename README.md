# WGCNA analysis of cfRNA data from HCC patients

This repistory is aimed at reproducing the results of the paper "Network analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma liquid biopsies augmented by single-cell sequencing data" https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.921195 and is written in R. 

The *.Rmd* files need to be run in the following order:
1. cfrna_input_clean.Rmd
2. cf_wgcna_suppl_file1_3.Rmd
3. exorna_input_clean.Rmd
4. exo_wgcna_suppl_file2_4.Rmd
5. metacell_construct.Rmd
6. mp_sc.Rmd 

Afterwards, the *.Rmd* files used to generate figures can be run in any desired order.
